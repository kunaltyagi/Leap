Welcome to Leap's documentation!
================================

Leap is a bare-basic implementation of how future CAD interfaces
would be like. It consists of

- input from a 3D device (currently Leap Motion) which is converted to **Gestures**. Each gesture signifies an action to the application.
- application which accepts the data in 3D unlike the 2D input from a mouse. The application here is a simple Cylinder being controlled in OpenGL
